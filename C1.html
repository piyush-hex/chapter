    <h1>Chapter 1 – Database Management System </h1>
    <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software solution designed to efficiently manage, organize, and retrieve data in a structured manner. It serves as a critical component in modern computing, enabling organizations to store, manipulate, and secure their data effectively. From small applications to enterprise systems, DBMS plays a vital role in supporting data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.A DBMS is a system that allows users to create, modify, and query databases while ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data access. Unlike traditional file systems, DBMS minimizes data redundancy, prevents inconsistencies, and simplifies data management with features like concurrent access and backup mechanisms. It organizes data into tables, views, schemas, and reports, providing a structured approach to data management.

            <h2 id="bold">Introduction to Data And Information</h2>
            <p>Data is defined as unstructured information such as text, observations, images, symbols, and descriptions. In other words, data provides no specific function and has no meaning on its own. Similarly, Information refers to processed, organized, and structured data. It gives context for the facts and facilitates decision making. In other words, information is processed data that makes sense to us.</p>

             <h2 id="bold">Normalization</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> Normalization is an important process in database design that helps improve the database's efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. It makes it easier to manage and maintain the data and ensures that the database is adaptable to changing business needs. </p>
        <p>The primary objective for normalizing the relations is to eliminate the below anomalies. Failure to reduce anomalies results in data redundancy, which may threaten data integrity and cause additional issues as the database increases. Normalization consists of a set of procedures that assist you in developing an effective database structure.</p>

        <h3 id="bold">Normal Forms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1NF (First Normal Form):</strong> Eliminate repeating groups; atomic columns.</li>
            <li><strong>2NF (Second Normal Form):</strong> Remove partial dependency on a composite key.</li>
            <li><strong>3NF (Third Normal Form):</strong> Remove transitive dependency.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="bold">Advantages</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Reduces data redundancy</li>
            <li>Improves data integrity</li>

           <h2 >Centralized and Distributed Database</h2>
        <h3 id="bold">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Centralized: AA centralized database stores all data in a single location, usually on one server or mainframe. Users access the database from that one central place. It’s easier to manage and maintain but can become a bottleneck or a single point of failure if the server goes down.

<br />
           Distributed: A distributed database stores data across multiple locations or servers that are connected via a network. Each site manages its own data but they all work together as one system. This improves reliability, availability, and can handle more users or larger data volumes.</p>

        <h3 id="bold">Advantages</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Centralized:</strong> Easier management, consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Improved reliability, scalability, and performance.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="bold">Disadvantages</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Centralized:</strong> Single point of failure, scalability limits.</li>

            Some past papers and questions:
        </h1>
    <h2 >1. What is Database and DBMS? List out the advantages and disadvantages of DBMS.</h2>
    <p>
       <strong>Ans:</strong> A Database is a structured collection of data that can be stored in both physical and digital form for easy and simple 
        access and management. For eg: A phonebook is an example of physical database and an online banking system can be
         example of digital database. A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that manages digital databases, providing users 
         and applications an interface to interact with data efficiently.</p>
         <p><strong>Advantages</strong> of DBMS are reduced data redundancy(data isnt repeated), improved data integrity i.e. it ensures that data is recorded
 exactly as intended and remains unchanged and uncorrupted during storage, transfer, and retrieval, enhanced data security, efficient data access, support for backup and recovery, and
  concurrent user access i.e. multiple users can utilize the database without interfearing with eachother.</p><p>
It's  <strong>Disadvantages</strong>  are increased system complexity, high cost, slower compared to simple file systems due to advanced features such as
 data integrity, security and querying , and potential security vulnerabilities if not managed properly.</p>
    </p>
<h2> Differentiate between file processing system and DBMS. Give at least four points. </h2>
<p>
    <strong>Ans:</strong>The difference between file system and DBMS are as follows:

                <tr><td>Data Redundancy</td><td>Redundant data can be present in a file system.</td><td>In DBMS there is no redundant data.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Backup and Recovery</td><td>It doesn't provide inbuilt mechanism for backup and recovery of data if it is lost.</td><td>It provides in-house tools for backup and recovery of data even if it is lost.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Query Processing</td><td>There is no efficient query processing in the file system.</td><td>Efficient query processing is there in DBMS.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Consistency</td><td>There is less data consistency in the file system.</td><td>There is more data consistency because of the process of normalization.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Complexity</td><td>It is less complex as compared to DBMS.</td><td>It has more complexity in handling as compared to the file system.</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Security Constraints</td><td>File systems provide less security in comparison to DBMS.</td><td>DBMS has more security mechanisms as compared to file systems.</td></tr>

<h2>What is a relational database? How is it different from other database models?</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Ans:</strong> 
        A <strong>Relational Database</strong> is a type of database that stores data in tables (called relations) consisting of rows and columns.
        Each table represents an entity (like Customers, Orders, Products), and each row is a record with unique data.
        Tables can be related to each other through keys, typically using a <em>primary key</em> and <em>foreign keys</em>.
      
      <h3 id="bold">Key features of relational databases:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Data organized in tables with rows and columns.</li>
        <li>Relationships between tables via keys.</li>
        <li>Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and managing data.</li>
        <li>Supports data integrity and avoids redundancy.</li>
      </ol>
     
        <h3 id="bold">Other common database models include:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Hierarchical Model:</strong> Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships.</li>
          <li><strong>Network Model:</strong> Similar to hierarchical but allows many-to-many relationships through graph structures.</li>
          <li><strong>Document Database (NoSQL):</strong> Stores data as documents (usually JSON or XML), good for unstructured or semi-structured data.</li>
          <li><strong>Key-Value Store (NoSQL):</strong> Stores data as simple key-value pairs, suitable for caching and fast lookups.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="bold">
          Differences of relational databases:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Structured and tabular:</strong> unlike NoSQL models that may be schema-less or document-based.</li>
          <li><strong>Strict schema:</strong> Relational databases enforce a fixed schema, ensuring data types and integrity.</li>
          <li><strong>ACID compliance:</strong> ensures reliable transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</li>
          <li><strong>Complex querying:</strong> SQL allows complex joins and queries, harder in some NoSQL models.</li>
        </ol>
      
</p>
    <h2>What is data redundancy? How does DBMS help in reducing it?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Ans:</strong> Data redundancy occurs when identical data is unnecessarily duplicated within a database or storage system.
         This repetition not only wastes valuable storage space but also creates challenges in data management. For instance, if customer 
         information or product details are stored in multiple tables or files, any update made in one location might not be reflected in
          others, leading to inconsistency and unreliable information. Such duplication increases the complexity of maintaining data 
          accuracy and can result in errors during data retrieval or reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Database Management System (DBMS) plays a crucial role in minimizing data redundancy by providing a centralized framework
         to store and manage data efficiently. Using techniques such as normalization, a DBMS organizes data into well-structured 
         tables that reduce duplication by storing each piece of information only once. It establishes relationships between tables 
         through keys, enabling data sharing without the need to replicate it. Furthermore, the DBMS enforces data integrity and 
         consistency by controlling how data is accessed and updated, ensuring that all changes are reflected uniformly across the
          database. This centralized control not only conserves storage resources but also simplifies database maintenance and improves 
          the reliability of data.

<H2>Define normalization. Explain 1NF, 2NF and 3NF with suitable examples. Explain the
    normalization process with examples.</H2>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Ans:</strong> Normal Forms in DBMS are a set of guidelines or rules used during database design to eliminate redundancy and dependency by organizing data into well-structured tables. The process that leads to these forms is called <strong>Normalization</strong>, and it ensures that data is stored in a logical and efficient manner. Normal Forms help avoid problems like insertion, update, and deletion anomalies by gradually refining the data structure across stages — namely First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), and Third Normal Form (3NF). Each normal form builds on the previous one by addressing specific types of redundancy or dependency issues. The aim is to make sure that each data item is stored in only one place, attributes are functionally dependent on the key, and no information is indirectly dependent on non-key attributes. The higher the level of normal form, the more structured and optimized the data becomes, leading to improved consistency, data integrity, and performance in queries and maintenance.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>First Normal Form (1NF)</strong> requires that each column in a table contains only atomic values, meaning each cell 
      should store a single value, and all entries in a column must be of the same type. For example, a column 
      like <code>PhoneNumbers</code> storing multiple numbers in one cell (e.g., "9841, 9801") violates 1NF. To bring it to
       1NF, each phone number should be stored in a separate row.<br>
       <BR> <strong>Second Normal Form (2NF)</strong> builds on 1NF by 
       eliminating partial dependency. It requires that all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the whole primary key, 
       especially in tables with composite keys. For example, if a table has <code>(StudentID, CourseID, StudentName)</code>, but
        StudentName only depends on StudentID, it must be moved to a separate table.<BR>
<bR>
         <strong>Third Normal Form (3NF)</strong> goes a step further by eliminating transitive dependencies, where a non-key 
         attribute depends on another non-key attribute. For instance,
         in a table with <code>(StudentID, CourseID, Instructor)</code>, if Instructor depends on CourseID rather than directly on 
         StudentID, it should be moved to another table related to CourseID. Through these stages, normalization transforms unstructured 
         or poorly designed tables into clean, well-linked, and highly efficient data models that are easier to query, scale, and manage.

    </p>
    <h2>9. Explain the terms: primary key, foreign key, and candidate key with examples.</h2>
    <p >
        <strong>Ans:</strong> In database systems, keys are essential for organizing data efficiently. A <strong>Primary Key</strong
             uniquely identifies each row in a table and cannot be null or duplicated. A <strong>Foreign Key</strong> creates a link
              between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. A <strong>Candidate Key</strong> is any column 
              (or set of columns) that can serve as a primary key because it uniquely identifies a row. Among all candidate keys,
               one is chosen as the primary key.

      <p >
        In the <strong>Student</strong> table, <code>StudentID</code> is the Primary Key. Both <code>Email</code> and 
        <code>PhoneNumber</code> are Candidate Keys because they are unique. In the <strong>Enrollment</strong> table,
         <code>StudentID</code> is a Foreign Key that references the <code>Student</code> table, maintaining referential 
         integrity. These key relationships are critical for efficient, accurate, and consistent data handling in relational databases.

      <h2>10. What is SQL? Explain its components and common functions.</h2>
      <p >
        <strong>Ans:</strong> SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standardized programming language used to manage and
         manipulate relational databases. It is used for performing various operations such as creating databases and tables,
          inserting data, updating data, retrieving information, and deleting records. SQL enables users to define, query, and 
          update data in a database with simple and readable commands. It is the backbone of relational database systems such as 
          MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. SQL is both powerful and user-friendly, allowing users to access vast
           amounts of data with minimal syntax.
      </p>
      
      <p >
        The major components of SQL include:<br>
        <strong>1) DDL (Data Definition Language):</strong> Used to define the structure of database objects such as tables, schemas, and indexes. Commands include <code>CREATE</code>, <code>ALTER</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>TRUNCATE</code>.<br>
        <strong>2) DML (Data Manipulation Language):</strong> Used to manipulate the data stored in the database. Includes <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, and <code>SELECT</code>.<br>
        <strong>3) DCL (Data Control Language):</strong> Manages permissions and access controls with commands like <code>GRANT</code> and <code>REVOKE</code>.<br>
        <strong>4) TCL (Transaction Control Language):</strong> Manages transactions in a database to ensure data integrity. Commands include <code>COMMIT</code>, <code>ROLLBACK</code>, and <code>SAVEPOINT</code>.
